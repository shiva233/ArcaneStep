Arcane Steps
Inspiration üå≤
We were inspired by the desire to make fitness and gaming more interactive. Combining the need for physical movement with the thrill of spell-casting in a fantasy world, Arcane Steps was born. The game challenges players to take steps and engage in an exciting magical journey, while also promoting healthy habits through movement.

What it does üå≤
Arcane Steps is a web-based game where players control a wizard who casts spells by walking. As players walk, their steps are tracked and converted into mana, which is used to cast spells and battle enemies. The game features a dynamic mana bar, enemy health tracking, and a persistent game state using LocalStorage.

How it works:
We believe the best way to encourage healthy movement is by integrating it with gaming mechanics. The more you walk, the more mana you generate, and the more powerful your spells become. This encourages players to stay active while enjoying the immersive fantasy world of Arcane Steps.

Game Mechanics:
Mana Bar: The wizard's mana is linked directly to the number of steps the player takes. Walk to generate mana and cast spells!

Enemy Battles: The enemy's health is tracked, and your spells affect their health as you progress.

LocalStorage: The game saves key data, such as your mana and the enemy's health, ensuring your progress persists even after a reload.

The Benefits:
Promotes Physical Activity: Encourages players to walk while playing, turning exercise into fun!

Engages the Mind: Enhances the gameplay experience with a sense of progression and reward.

Accessible Gameplay: Simple mechanics make it easy for anyone to jump in and start playing right away.

Arcane Steps ‚ÄúReward‚Äù System:
We don't stop at just fun gameplay. We elevate the experience by rewarding your progress in the game! üå≤

The Mana System: The more steps you take, the more mana you accumulate. This lets you cast powerful spells and defeat the enemy wizard.

Persistent Progress: With LocalStorage, your steps, mana, and the enemy‚Äôs health are saved, meaning you can pick up right where you left off after a page reload.

Why it works:

Motivation through Progress: The more consistent you are with walking, the more powerful your wizard becomes, encouraging long-term engagement.

Fun and Fitness Combined: The game makes physical activity enjoyable and motivates players to move every day, without it feeling like exercise.

How we built it üå≤
We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this project, keeping the focus on building an immersive and interactive experience while ensuring that the game runs smoothly in the browser.

JavaScript: Manages the logic for walking (step count), mana generation, spell casting, and enemy health.

LocalStorage: Stores the game state across sessions, so your progress isn't lost when the page reloads.

CSS: Provides a clean, responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring the game looks good on both mobile and desktop.

Challenges we ran into üå≤
Step Detection: Getting accurate step tracking while making sure the game responds in real time was a bit tricky. We had to experiment with different methods to ensure smooth gameplay.

LocalStorage Synchronization: Ensuring the correct data is saved and reloaded properly across sessions required fine-tuning, especially with dynamically changing elements like mana and enemy health.

Game Balance: Adjusting the rate at which mana is generated from steps and the damage dealt to enemies to make the game both fun and challenging was a delicate balance.
